Responsive-Tables
=================

"Responsive Tables" is a Joomla 2.5x plugin designed to make "responsive design" any HTML / CSS table.

I was looking for a responsive table for a client website. I've founded lot of interesting things but nothing seemed to meet the criteria I had for a powerful implementation:
    Do not break the responsive layouts of the template
	  Still lets you compare the rows
    Doesn't unnecessarily hide the datas
    Light is right, but free is better !
    
This plugin works by taking the first column and "pinning" it to the left of the table, allowing you to scroll the other columns under it. You don't lose the key for each row and you also don't break the responsive layout.
